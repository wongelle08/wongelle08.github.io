# Yiran Wang

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Alabama.
My research focuses on numerical analysis, multiscale finite element methods,
reduced-order modeling, and operator learning for partial differential equations (PDEs)
and inverse problems.

## Short Bio

I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Central China Normal University (2014–2018) and my Ph.D.
in Mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (2018–2022), supervised by Prof. Eric Chung. 
From 2022 to 2024, I was a Golomb Visiting Assistant Professor at Purdue University, where I worked
with Prof. Suchuan Dong.

I joined The University of Alabama as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 2024.

## Research Interests

- Multiscale finite element methods (e.g., GMsFEM)  
- Reduced-order modeling and model reduction for parametrized and stochastic PDEs  
- Operator learning and neural networks for PDEs (e.g., DeepONet-type architectures)  
- Inverse problems for nonlinear Schrödinger equations and multiscale flow

## Teaching

Since joining The University of Alabama, I have taught both undergraduate and graduate courses in applied and computational mathematics. These include:

### Undergraduate Courses
- **MATH 237 – Introduction to Linear Algebra**  

- **MATH 359 – Mathematical Theory of Data Science**  

### Graduate Course
- **MATH 511 – Numerical Analysis I**  

I aim to help students develop strong mathematical foundations while connecting theory with computation, modeling, and modern data-driven methodologies.
