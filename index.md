# Yiran Wang

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Alabama.
My research focuses on numerical analysis, multiscale finite element methods,
reduced-order modeling, and operator learning for partial differential equations (PDEs)
and inverse problems.

I am particularly interested in combining classical numerical methods with modern
neural operator and deep learning architectures to solve and invert multiscale and
random PDE models arising in wave propagation, porous media flow, and related applications.
